# Getting started

You can find this package in the
[official Typst package repository](https://github.com/typst/packages).
To use it, start your document with
```typ
{{#include IMPORT.typ}}
```
You now have two options:
1. use the features of Polylux but define every visual aspect yourself,
2. start from one of the
  [templates](https://typst.app/universe/search/?q=polylux&kind=templates).

We will first explore how you can get started without the support of themes.
Later, we will see how you can employ them to get beautiful slides without having
to do the design work yourself.
